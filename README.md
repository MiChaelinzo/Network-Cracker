# Network-Cracker
This code is a part of a class that is used to crack passwords. The class is initialized with a license key and a debug level, which are passed to a library called EIP2 to initialize it. Next, the code creates a password from a string ("abcd") and sets it as the target password that the class will attempt to crack. 
This code is a part of a class that is used to crack passwords. The class is initialized with a license key and a debug level, which are passed to a library called EIP2 to initialize it. Next, the code creates a password from a string ("abcd") and sets it as the target password that the class will attempt to crack. It then initializes a number of "regular attacks" and calls a setup_server_ipv6 function to set up the IP address of a server. It is not clear what the code does after this point, as the rest of the code is not shown.
